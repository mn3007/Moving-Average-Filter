# Moving-Average-Filter
The following is a project report written for ECS707 Lab 1. This report briefly describes the implementation of a moving average filter on ocean buoy data  measured off the coast of Oceanside, California, during March 2006.  The peak period and significant wave height were plotted as functions of time, then a moving average was performed on the peak period data using window size M = 5, 21 and 51. It was found that the moving average smooths the data. The moving average is similar to a low-pass filter in that it attenuates high frequencies.
The code for this project is available at https://github.com/mn3007/Moving-Average-Filter.
